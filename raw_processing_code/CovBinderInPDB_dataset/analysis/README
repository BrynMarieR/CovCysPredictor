# assign Uniprot name to each PDB_ID/chain
./pdb2uniprot.py pdbs_list.txt pdbs_cys_uniprot.csv

# side note: one can find covalently modified Cysteine in a PDB by
# parsing the LINK records: grep "^LINK" *.pdb | grep CYS
# Andrei parsed all the LINK records in these PDBs and summarized them
# in "pdbs_cys_link.csv" -- need to clean-up a bit (remove duplicate
# entries which can occur with alternate positions, etc)
# Merge Uniprot (pdbs_cys_uniprot.csv) and LINK (pdbs_cys_link.csv) data
