# Protocol Details 
# Focused on Chains together(CT) for the systems since from previous iterations of the protocol, we observed better model performance. This is likely due to larger predicted solvent exposure for systems where chains were kept together as opposed to being split into separate units. The solvent exposure term is a crucial component in our model. 

# For NQNC (No Quickprep,No Chains) protocol -- remove ligand from raw PDB and run residue property prediction without Quickprep 
Protocol involves:
(1) Add hydrogens and charges to structure(s)...
(2) Split complex into receptor, ligand, solvent....
(3) Use receptor(s) only downstream ...
(4) Generate protein residue report(s)...
(5) Write report.txt

# For SQCT (Single Quickprep,Chains Together) protocol -- split raw PDB into receptor/ligand/solvent/ions and run Quickprep on receptor prior to residue property prediction 
Protocol involves:
(1) Add hydrogens and charges to structure(s)...
(2) Split complex into receptor, ligand, solvent....
(3) Prepare receptor(s) only with QuickPrep ...
(4) Use receptor(s) only downstream ...
(5) Generate protein residue report(s)...
(6) Write report.txt.

# For DQCT (Double Quickprep,Chains Together) protocol -- Run Quickprep on struture, then split raw PDB into receptor/ligand/solvent/etc and then run Quickprep on receptor prior to residue property prediction 
#  Protocol involves:
(1) Prepare whole structure(s) with QuickPrep...
(2) Split complex into receptor, ligand, solvent....
(3) Prepare receptor(s) only with QuickPrep ...
(4) Use receptor(s) only downstream ...
(5) Generate protein residue report(s)...
(6) Write report.txt.

#Done.
